## Drawing-FPS
Software for drawing PC FPS  
Depending on the device  
Program processing does not work well  
It seems that the program sometimes crashes.  

## Drawing-CPS
Clicking the Button on Form consecutively displays the CPS on the Label  
Each time a Button is clicked, clickCount is incremented.  
Timer also calculates the number of 
seconds elapsed from the last click time to the current time to obtain the CPS.  
timer fires a Tick event every second and displays the CPS on the Label.
